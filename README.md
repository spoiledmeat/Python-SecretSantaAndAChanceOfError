# Python-SecretSantaAndAChanceOfError
A flawed officiator for secret Santa. Do not use except to mock.

This is a Python script I wrote in 2016 which aimed to officiate a game of secret santa between my friends and I.

There are problems with the script. When tested, I found that there was about a 5% chance of error (over millions of trials!) that someone would have not been matched, someone would have been matched with themselves, or other game-breaking behavior.
I do not recommend you use this code for your own secret santa game. A different, boring, WORKING version is also on my github (/spoiledmeat).
